Hey everyone,  
In this repo, I worked on a dataset about cars and tried to predict car prices based on other factors. I focused on understanding the data deeply, finding patterns, exploring variable relationships, and seeing how they affect price.

I really enjoyed working on this project, especially using statistics and math to test things and draw conclusions. It was super fun to finally see the practical side of what we usually study in theory.

One of the main challenges was the small size of the dataset, which made it hard to get accurate results at first. So I had to check a few assumptions, fix some issues, and think of ways to improve the model. After that, I managed to boost the accuracy up to 97%.

I learned and tried a lot of new things for the first time, and honestly, I had a great time doing it. There's so much more in the notebook, and I think it’s best if you check it out yourself.

Wanna check out the interactive version with charts and live outputs?
